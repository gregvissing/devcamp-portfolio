                long so folks can pick up some informative tidbits. Then, link them off to some social networking sites or contact information.
                
                Below are a few of the websites I've developed along with the CMS used for each. I worked with many talented Web Designers 
                to bring each client's idea to life. A lot of research went into learning new styling and animation techniques for each. Each was tested 
                on every major browser and device to give the end user the best experience possible. Enjoy!</p>
